So first of this gray background is not bad but it's too dark. This is not Louvre pastel colors, know what I mean? Next. Next, let's redesign the enter page and the loading page. Keep in mind this has to be the most high and look the current implementation is amateur the enter page and the loading page.

This needs to be the most high-end, Louvre, million dollar project budget, GSAP, expert, senior, GSAP knowledge using project. It a huge project okay Because it the first impression we need to make it count and it needs to utilize gsap in bleeding edge ways for 2026 you need to utilize context 7 mcp learn everything about gsap okay then afterwards create a markdown file where the awward jury specs out the actual project okay that will guarantee be a winner three years in a row for for the AWWWARD because it's so perfect.

You simulate the top three jury members and they spec out the project fully start to finish. Afterwards you go in and set up a multi P-H-A-S-E-S to-do list in your internal to-do list system and then you work it all off, okay?

It's gonna be the biggest, biggest, biggest, biggest, biggest, longest, longest, longest, longest, longest, biggest ever, okay? Thank you.
