In general the light mode seems to have severe issues, the dark mode looks much better. Optimize the light mode system-wide properly. Okay, so it's production ready, unicorn level, artistic ready for the louvre to be presented. Your trial has expired. Upgrade to VoiceInk Pro at tryvoiceink.com/buy

And what the f**k is this scroll to explore? There is no scrolling going on, is there? If you scroll, it should trigger the card that happens if I click on enter, okay?
