So look, when I play the game, like I make music, everything works perfect the first time, but I have to make sure both hands are in the screen when I turn on the mode, when I click on the speaker icon, right? But then once I move my hands down and the music stops, I cannot bring them back up and continue.

I have to like reload the entire page and start this whole process again. We need to make this proper, proper reliable and fix all this mess, okay?
