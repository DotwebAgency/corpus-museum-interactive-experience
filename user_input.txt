We need to really really now look at the onboarding tutorial. It doesn't really integrate in the UI at all. It overlaps with the character. Know what I mean?

It needs to be in a side... like look when you click on the question mark the side sidebar slides out. We need to use the same logic for the onboarding tutorial in a way so it doesn't overlap with the character. Also it needs to be fully brand aligned in our design identity.

The full logic and everything needs to be perfect, okay? Not too long, not too short, just in exactly the sweet spot Goldilocks zone. And for this, create a markdown file in the project route, flash this out through the lens, simulate the design, awwward, jury members explaining how this has to be done and then set it up, okay?

In a long, long to-do list to make it happen.
