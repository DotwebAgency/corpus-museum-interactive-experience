I'm stuck at the try opening your mouth step that one is not registering also my mouth doesn't work as an instrument and We should use some glass morphism on this onboarding tutorial and then the bottom bar is now way too high way too high We need to integrate all of this way better All of it like this makes no sense like this And all of this is not really in our brand identity.

The bottom bar, this new help overlay, the help overlay should slide in, should be part of the actual experience. I should still see myself. Now about the audio. Audio doesn't work. Your trial has expired. Upgrade to VoiceInk Pro at tryvoiceink.com/buy
