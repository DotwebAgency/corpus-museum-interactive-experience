So the audio feature was working for a moment, it was working beautifully, but now it just doesn't work anymore. Click on the audio thing. By the way, the logic is inverted there. When it's enabled, you have a closing X there, right?

That doesn't make sense. It should be a lot of around. Anyways, it doesn't work no matter which one I select. Japanese, Dorian, Pentatonic, I lift my arms and stuff and the audio doesn't happen anymore. Why?
